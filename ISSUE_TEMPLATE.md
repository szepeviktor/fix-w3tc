Thank you for reporting an issue!

Please make sure you describe the issue and your use case.

It is helpful if you provide details of your environment:

- Webserver name and version 
- PHP version and handler type (e.g. mod_php, suPHP, PHP-FPM)
- Database server name and version
- WordPress core version
- W3 Total Cache plugin version

Please provide an error log if you can by adding these lines to your `wp-config.php`:


define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );

WordPress puts the error log in `/wp-content/debug.log`

If you are also proposing a solution then please make sure to elaborate on why your solution is adequate.

# Fix W3TC (W3 Total Cache) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/szepeviktor/fix-w3tc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/szepeviktor/fix-w3tc)

The aim is to continuously incorporate fixes, improvements, and enhancements over the official (and long abandoned: 2 years) Wordpress release of [W3 Total Cache v0.9.4.1](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/).
